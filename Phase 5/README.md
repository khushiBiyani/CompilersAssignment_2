# Phase 5 covers the Final Execution of input program

To run the code:

run command

./bash execute.sh


The code can also explicitly be run using the commands:
1. flex scanner.l
2. yacc -d parser.y
3. gcc y.tab.c lex.yy.c -w
4. ./a.out input.c
5. ./executor.bin

This takes input from the file "input.c"
