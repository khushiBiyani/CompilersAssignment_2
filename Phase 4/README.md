# Phase 4 covers the Intermediate Code Generation (ICG) of input program to display Three Address Code in QUADRUPLE format

To run the code:

run command

./bash TAC.sh


The code can also explicitly be run using the commands:

1. yacc -d TAC.y
2. flex TAC.l
3. gcc y.tab.c -ll -ll
4. ./a.out

This takes input from the file "input.c"
